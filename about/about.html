    <h1>About me</h1>
    <div id="history">
      <p>Originally from Southern California, about fifteen minutes from the border, I have spent most of my life moving around the country because of my father's work. Being an military brat, I had to adapt to an entirely unfamiliar environment every few years before leaving for another state as soon as I'd started getting used to the old one. School was never an issue for me; I paid attention during class and retained enough information from lectures and homework to pass with straight A's. Unsure of what I wanted to do after high school, my next step was community college where I figured I could get some of the gen-ed courses out of the way. Shortly after, the pandemic started to make its way into the country and kept everyone inside. Courses were quickly shifted to an online only format to accomodate the new reality we found ourselves in, and I spent the rest of my college career taking courses online ending up with an associates in computer information technology. More recently, at the beginning of 2022 I started working on Codecademy's Full-Stack Engineer course. I enjoy working towards a clearly defined goal and figuring out the ways to get there; coding gives me a way to practice both artistic/design skills and my ability to problem solve. Wherever I end up is where I'm meant to be.</p>
